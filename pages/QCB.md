Welcome to the *Tutorial* section for the course of **Computational Biophysics** at the University of Trento for the a.y. 2018-2019.

The tutorials will cover the laboratory segment of the course, and will be a variation on the [tutorials](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/) and/or 
some [case studies](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/CaseStudies/) of the [Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/) at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Other sources will be properly cited, whenever it is possible due to time constraints. My own additions will also be present.

All the errors presents will be on my own only. If you find any of them, along with bugs and suggestions, please let me know via email or PR on github.
