In this session we will build the setup, analyse the configuration file and
perform a small analysis of a system.[^1]

[^1]: This tutorial is based on [NAMD tutorial]() and [BPTI case study]().

I encourage you to have a look at the
### Getting ready
For this tutorial, download the following
#FIXME: add source [source file]().
You should know how to untar, but let's remind it:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ tar xvzf tutorial3.tar.gz</p>

#FIXME: add folderlist
There should be two folders: `foo/` and `bar/`.

## Overview
Let's recap the so called **MD machinery**.

<p class="prompt prompt-question">What files do we need?</p>
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/quiz.png" alt="">

<p class="prompt prompt-question">What files do we use?</p>

## PAR file
Last time we saw the several files, but we did not have a look at the parameters
file.
Let's open `par_all36m_prot.prm` with _ViM_.
There is a section for all the interaction we saw last time.

<p class="prompt prompt-question"> Do you see other potential functions not
defined in the last lesson?</p>

We  mentioned that the force field has to be taken as a whole, since several
approximations are hidden in the parameter definition.

Other _parameters_ must be set for the non-bonded interactions (the exact meaning
  will be defined in other lessons):
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/par_nb.png" alt="">

The meaning of these commands is not important for this tutorial, but the
take-home message to remember is:

<p align="center">"You should **not** change parameters at your own will, unless
 you want to introduce a systematic error in your simulation
  and make them useless.""</p>

or, in another way:
<p align="center">First rule of the FF-Club is **Do not mess with the FF**.</p>
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/newton_club.jpg" alt="">

So, now we have an (almost) complete overview of the files we will deal with.
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/quiz_done.png" alt="">
Congrats for the correct answer! ;)


## The Problem
Before launching a simulation, let's see what are the time scale we can
investigate. For now, with _MD_ we mean _all-atom MD_.

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/time_scale.png" alt="">

From the picture above we see that we are constrained both spatially and in the
simulated time, since the idea is to publish and we don't have infinite resources
(someone pays the bill for the electric power used by computers).

When you decide to perform a simulation some questions should be answered in advance:
1. What process I want to investigate? Is it feasible?
2. Do I have enough resources? (in general you hope so)
3. What level of detail do I need?

We will keep these question in mind, but we will ignore them for now.


## MD in a nutshell
We have already seen that performing a molecular dynamics simulation means solving
numerically the Newton's equations of motion for each atoms in order to evolve the
system at the next time step.

To do so, we usually employ the (velocity-)Verlet algorithm, described below.

<p align="center">
$$
\begin{align*}
    r_i(t+\Delta t) & = r_i(t) + v_i(t) \Delta t+ \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m_i}F_i(t)\\
    v_i(t+\Delta t) & = v_i(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{2m_i}\big[F_i(t+\Delta t) + F_i(t)\big]\\
\end{align*}
$$
</p>

<p class="prompt prompt-question">What information do we need to implement the
Verlet algorithm?</p>

<p align="center">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
suspence...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

We will need to provide:
1. the initial positions of the atoms in the system;
2. the potential energy to compute the forces from;
3. the masses of the atoms;
4. the time step of integration;
5. the initial velocity of atoms.

We already saw the first three requirements.

The **time step** should be as large as possible, in order to achieve
long simulated times. But (there is always a caveat) we do not want to have
huge errors due to the integration. Moreover with super-long time step, atoms
will move too much and they would overlap resulting a high repulsive force.
<p class="prompt prompt-question">How is the repulsive force implemented?</p>
The choice of the time step in based on the fastest motion in the system.
In particular, it should be 1/10 of this fastest motion. For all-atom simulation,
the hydrogen vibrations in bonds with heavy atoms have a period of ~10 fs.
Therefore we would use a timestep of 1 fs (**maybe**).

The initial velocities are in general assigned from a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution at the desired temperature, but they can be set to a random values,
extracted from a uniformdistribution etc...

With all these pieces of information, we can performed a simulation in a,
so called, **NVE ensemble** [^3], where the number of particles, the volume and
the total energy of the system is conserved.

[^3]: Please notice it is written with the **e**, ens**e**mble.

But usually, we want to compute quantities that the experimentally measured. And
in experiments what is fixed is not the energy but the temperature, or not the
volume but the pressure.

Therefore, we need to introduce two new ingredients that will be explained in the
theoretical lessons: a _thermostat_ and a _barostat_.
These two pieces will help us in simulating our system in the correct ensemble,
**NVT** and **NpT**.

An ingredient that is not evident from the above discussion is ihe necessity to
reproduce experimental results.

The workflow of your simulation would look like this:
1. build the setup:
2. minimise the system;
3. equilibrate the system in **NVT**;
4. equilibrate the system in **NpT**;
5. go back to **NVT** to reduced the perturbation introduced in your system.

Depending on the system, step _5_ may not be performed.


## BPTI
The _bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor_ is a small protein extensively studied
since the dawn of Molecular Dynamics. It inhibits the enzyme trypsin, responsible
for the protein digestion.


<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/bpti.png" alt="">

It was the first macromolecule of biological relevance simulated with MD with the
seminal paper  _Dynamics of folded proteins_ by McCammon, Gelin and Karplus.

The BTPI binds the trypsin hindering the ability of cleaving other proteins.
For more details, see the _Notes_.

Load the complex in the `bpti_trypsin/` folder and check the `LYS15` of the bpti.


### PSF
Let's start from the pdb of the protein alone from the previous tutorial.
We will build again the `psf` with the _AutoPSF_ plugin.

Open _VMD_ in your working folder `tutorial3`, and load your pdb file.
Now go to _Extension -> Modeling
-> Automatic PSF Builder_.
A new window pops up:

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/autopsf.png" alt="">
The steps we will perform is:
1. Check if our molecule is properly loaded;
2. Select the output name or use the default one;
3. Delete the default `top*` files and add our own;
4. Load the input files;
5. Guess and create the chains;
6. Check if our patches are automagically imported;
7. Finish the psf.

<p class="prompt prompt-attention">
Check the correctness of the patches! </p>

It will create and load a new molecule, both `psf` and `pdb`.

## Implicit solvent
Last time we performed few time step of a simulation in vacuum. Of course,
proteins do not _live_ in the outer space in a _galaxy far, far away..._
(unless we are studying *Midi-chlorian*, Ã§a va sans dire).

Proteins lives in an aqueous environment, with ions, all kinds
of ligands and so on and so forth. We would like mimic as good as possible
the biological environment by adding **explicitly** water molecules. This will
be done in few steps. But in this section we will use an **implicit solvent
model**.

**Implicit Solvent** model is a computational technique that introduces many
effects due to solvent-solute interactions, such as screening effects,
without using the water atoms. Removing the water molecules accelerates
the simulation both in the exploration of the solute conformations,
and in the _CPU time_ required to actually do the computation.

<p class="prompt prompt-attention">Implicit models are less accurate than
the explicit counterpart!</p>

In particular we will use the _Generalised Born implicit solvent_ (**GBIS**)
model. The details are left for the theoretical part of the course.
The main idea is to screen more the atoms nearby the surface of the protein nearby
the solvent (and give them a _small effective radius_) and the opposite for the buried atoms inside the protein.

The parameters that we have to set are:
- `gbis yes`: we want to use the _GBIS_;
- `cutoff 14`: for the electrostatic interactions (in Angstrom);
- `alphaCutoff 12`: to determine the appropriate radius (in Angstrom);
- `ionconcentration `: the default value is `0.2`.

Let's open the configuration file for this simulation and see what is inside.
<p class="prompt prompt-info">The section we will not discuss are defined by <br>
# <--! <br>
... <br>
# !--> </p>

Fix the lines left blank in the configuration file, and then launch the
simulation.

This time we will slightly modify the launching command:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ namd2 +p2 conf.namd > bubu.log &</p>


To check how much time the program needs, type in the shell:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ grep "^TIMING" bubu.log </p>
For 100k steps it will take 20 minutes.


Several files will be dumped from NAMD:
- `.log` file;
- `.dcd`: trajectory;
- `.restart.*`: to restart the simulation;
- `.coor`: binary for coordinates;
- `.vel`: binary for velocities;
- `.xsc/.xst`: for the simulation box;

Let's start from the `.log` file.
Let's open it with _ViM_. There are a lot of information written in it, such as
the initialisation of the system, checking the number of atoms, the existence of the
files, the correctness of the parameters file, the recap of the setup defined
in the configuration file.

Search the word `Benchmark`. The data you find here are useful to establish
the amount of resources (CPU/GPU) you should use.

Then we can check the thermodynamics quantities we asked to compute on the fly.
They will be written as row each defined timestep.
The keywords are `ETITLE` to have the headers of the columns, and `ENERGY`
for the actual values.

While the simulation is running, you can write a `tcl` script to compute the
_Root mean square displacement_ of the protein. It is defined as:

$$ RMSD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N (r_i^2(t) - r_i^2(0))}$$

Usually it is performed considering only the C$$\alpha$$ and the following
procedure is followed:
1. Align the structure of each frame to the first frame structure, in order
to remove the roto-translation of the system;
2. Compute the RMSD.

This quantity gives a qualitative estimate of the convergence of the simulation.
We can define two segments of the total simulated time:
- an **equilibration** phase that allows the system to reach the """equilibrium"""
- a **production** phase from which we will compute the data we want.

A criterion to check the equilibration of a system is to check for a plateau
in the _rmsd_.

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Write the rmsd.tcl script</p>

Once the simulation is completed, let's analyse the output in the `.log` file.

In _VMD_ go in _Extension -> Analysis -> NAMD Plot_.
You should see this:
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut3/namd_plot.png" alt="">

Load the `.log` file and analyse the `TEMP`.

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Can you explain the behaviour of the
temperature?</p>.

We can also save the extracted info, but it is too cumbersome (imho).
So let's use the `shell`.

The idea is to extract from the `log` file some lines. We will use the following
commands:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ grep "^ETITLE" bubu.log |
tail -n 1 > thermo.dat <br>
$ grep "^ENERGY" bubu.log >> thermo.dat</p>

See if the file is properly written. And now let's plot something.
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ gnuplot <br>
> set key autotitle columnheader<br>
> p "thermo.dat" u 2:13 w l </p>

    - potential energy
    - these quantities equilibrate faster than the protein (#TODO: check). compare with rmsd

- initialisation of velocity uniform and/or MB

- printing out velocities for MB/specific heat.


#TODO: see namd tutorial

(while the simulation is running, go on)


## Solvation box

- create the psf of the system solvation + 7.5 Angstrom + ionisation

why do we solvate/ionise the system

- minimisation

- 100 ps of position restrained

- simulation NVT

For

- simulation npt as equilibration

- nvt again
#TODO: how long does explicit sim take?

- PBC

- solvate with tkconsole

- ionise with GUI

- launch with more cores.(probably reduce cutoff to 9 to have a smaller box)

- error on the temperature/fluctuations

- initialisation of velocity uniform and/or MB

To launch `namd` using more cores you can use:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ namd2 -pN conf.namd > lognameN.log & </p>
where `N` is the number of cores available.
Launch the same simulation using 1,2,3,4 processes (change also the logfile name).
In general you should be able to run with `4` cores,
but remember that your computer needs some resources for the
opetating system. Therefore, you may not see an increase in the performances
for 3 processes to 4.
<p class="prompt prompt-attention">
1) The output will be overwritten.<br>
2) If you want to do a for-loop modify the command above (hint:`&`)
</p>

# AWK detour
_AWK_ is a scripting language to manipulate text. It is particular useful for small
tasks that do not rqeuire a lot of lines of code.

The basic syntax of an _awk_ instruction is:
`awk '{some actions}' < input.file`.
_awk_ will loop over the lines of the file and perform the actions you wrote.
The default variables you will need are:
- `NF`: number of fields (i.e. columns separated as default by blank spaces);
- `NR`: number of rows (i.e. lines), the counter over which the default
 loop is performed;
- `$0`: a whole line;
- `$i`: the i-th field;
Moreover you can do operation at the before (`BEGIN`) and after (`END`)
 the main loop.
First, create a file with 1 column filled with numbers from 1 to 100.
**Hint**: use a bash for-loop.

Then, let's compute the sum and the average.
```bash
awk 'BEGIN{sum=0} {sum += $1} END{print "sum:", sum, "\navg:", sum}' < gauss_spicciame_casa.dat
```
See _Notes_ for more information and fancy things[^2].

[^2]: Rtfm on `man awk`, or use Google.

---

Now that we know a bit of _awk_, let's use it for our purposes.
First let's see how different numbers of cores affect the computation.
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ grep "Benchmark" logname1.log </p>

Let's see what is inside.

From these lines we can extract the information we need sending them as input
for _awk_ by using `|`.

<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ grep "Benchmark" logname1.log |
 awk '{print $X, $Y, $Z}' > benchmark.dat </p>

Of course we can do the same for all the 4 logfiles.
<p class="prompt prompt-question">When do you have the ""best"" perfomances?</p>


---
- awk for TIMING/BENCHMARK
- using different cores, extract info of Benchmark with `for i; do grep "" $i| awk`



- awk to extract info

- rmsd (should I put it at the beginning)

# BLACKBOX section
The idea is to group the commands that we don't want to explain into
a section called black box.
We can put here all the instructions not mandatory for the computation
that they will be explained in the next theoretical lessons, such as:
- neighbour List
- switching distance
- cutoff
- PME
- rigid bonds
- pressure coupling
- others?

<!--
## May the Force (field) be with you!

The idea is to solve the Newton's equations of motion for all the atoms in the
system. For each atom in 1D we can write:

$$m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\nabla U$$

We need then to know what the potential $$U$$ is. The set of functions and parameters
that composes the $$U$$ is called **Force Field** (**ff** from now on).

The idea behind **ffs** is to mimic the experimental behaviour of proteins with a
potential for atoms that has a
feasible computational cost.
There are several force fields available, such as:
- CHARMm, AMBER for all-atom simulations;
- Martini for coarse grained simulations.

Each ff has its own functional form and its protocol to define parameters. The parameters, in fact, hide under the hood assumptions that make the functional formation viable for simulations. Mixing CHARMm parameters with the AMBER potential,
to mention two of the most popular ffs, will lead you to unreliable results.

<p class="prompt prompt-attention">Do not mix parameters from different force
fields!</p>

Moreover, ff parameters evolve as more data and simulations are gathered.

<p class="prompt prompt-attention">Check for the latest version of force fields!</p>
We will mainly use CHARMm ff (version 36).

In general, each force field has two main parts (we are omitting the dependence
  on the coordinates and parameters that will be clear in the following):
\$$ U_{ff} = U_{bonded} + U_{non~bonded} $$

Let's have a graphical representation.
<p align="center"> <b>Bonded interactions</b> </p>

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/bonded.png" alt="">

<p align="center"> <b>Non-bonded interactions</b> </p>
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/non_bonded.png" alt="">


As their name suggest, we can define interactions for covalently bonded atoms as:

$$
\begin{align*}
  U_{bonded} & = \sum_{bonds} \frac{1}{2}k_{bond} (r_{ij} - r_0)^2 \\
      & +  \sum_{angles} \frac{1}{2} k_{angle} (\theta_{ijk} - \theta_{0})^2 \\
   & + \sum_{dihedrals} k_{\phi,n} [\cos(n\phi_{ijkl} +\delta_n) +1]\\
   & + \sum_{impropers} k_{improper} (\chi_{i^{*}jkl} - \chi_0)^2
\end{align*}
$$

but we have also to take into account non-bonded interactions between molecules and
within molecules:

$$
\begin{align*}
  U_{non~bonded} & = \sum_{nb~pairs} \Big[ \frac{q_i q_j}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_{ij}}
  + \Big(\frac{A_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{12}} - \frac{B_{ij}}{r_{ij}^6}\Big)\Big]\\
\end{align*}
$$

# Alanine dipeptide
Alanine dipeptide is a small peptide usually used to study protein backbone
 dynamics. It consists of an `ALA` in the middle equipped with two minimal peptide bonds. The N terminus _NH2_ gains an acetyl group _CH3CO_, while the the C terminus
 _COOH_ obtains a methylamide _CH3NH_.

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/alanine_dip.png" alt="">
<p align="center"> ACE - ALA - NME </p>

<p class="prompt prompt-question">How many carbon atoms are in the alanine dipeptide?<br>
Are C atoms bonded with the same kind of atoms each time they appear?</p>


A `pdb` and a `top` file for the alanine dipeptide is provided.
Let's inspect the content of these files.

<p class="prompt prompt-attention">Use Vim! :)</p>

In the same folder you have also a configuration file called `vacuum.namd`.
It is required to launch **NAMD** and perform the simulation. It is a `Tcl`
script were you can set the parameters of your simulation, the algorithms you want
to use, and the output.
Let's open it as well.

Let's run the simulation! It will take few minutes.
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ namd2 vacuum.namd > ala_vacuum.log &</p>

<p class="prompt prompt-question">What does > and & do?</p>

Try to use the `tail` command:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ tail -f *.log </p>
Use `ctrl-s` to stop the shell screen if it is too fast. To resume the scroll,
use `ctrl-q`.

After the simulation is completed, load with the `Tk console` in _VMD_
the `pdb` and the trajectory.
<p class="prompt prompt-tk">% mol new dip.pdb<br>
% mol addfile file.dcd waitfor all</p>

Let's compute the dihedral angles $$\phi$$, whose definition is
$$C_{i-1}-N_{i}-C\alpha_{i}-C_{i}$$, and $$\psi$$, dihedral defined by
$$N_{i}-C\alpha_{i}-C_{i}-N_{i+1}$$.

**Hint**: you `measure`,`4`, _Extension_.

## Coordinates: PDB
We have already see a `pdb` file few moments ago.

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/pdb.png" alt="">
Let's go the [Protein Data Bank website](https://www.rcsb.org/) and search for the
structure `4pti`.

Let's give a brief overview of these columns
- `serial`: integer associated to each atom;

- `name`: `atom name` of each atom (see figure below);

- `resname`: 3-letter code for protein, it can be a 4-letter code for fancy residues;

- `chain`: 1-letter identifier for each chain in a pdb;

- `x`, `y`, and  `z`: try to guess;

- `occupancy`: usually `1.00`, it can be less than 1 if the structure is not univocally resolved;

- `beta factor`: temperature $$\beta_i = \frac{8\pi^2}{3}~msf_i$$, it is related to the flexibility of the residue;

- `element`.

Regarding the atom names, they follow the _star_ convention:
from $$\alpha$$ (of the Carbon $$\alpha$$) to $$\beta, \gamma, \delta$$...
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/his.png" alt="">
<p align="center"> Histidine, as a constellation.</p>
<p class="prompt prompt-attention">PDB files have a fixed format. Do not
modify them manually if you are unsure of the outcome!</p>

Move the `pdb` file from `~/Download/` into `QCB_course/bpti/`.

Let's open it (with ViM!). For sake of safety, use:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ vim -R 4pti.pdb</p>

Let's search the keyword we already know. Type in the _Vim_ `Normal mode`:
`/ATOMS ` (note the white space after the `S`).

`ATOMS`, `HETATM` define the rows in which atoms are written. The first is used
for the atoms of the proteins, ligands and water atoms are defined by the latter.

Let go at the beginning of the file (`gg` in _ViM_).
There are a lot of information, most of the are experimental data.
They are characterised by the keywords in the first column.
Some of them will be explained in the next lessons.
Now, go to the first `SEQRES` (search within _ViM_).

Let's focus on the `SSBOND` keyword. In this section, if present, disulfide bonds
are defined.
These are bonds between the sulfur `S` atoms of two close cysteins.
Disulfide bonds play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins,
therefore you have to include them in your future structure.

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Write down the resid of the disulfide bonds.</p>

Load the pdb with _VMD_, and remove the water from the visualisation.
Visualise in _Licorice_, if present, aspartic acids, glutammic acid, lysine and arginine.


Visualise the disulfide bridges.
<p class="prompt prompt-question">Does VMD create a link between 2 close sulfur atoms? Is it "real"?</p>

Visualise the protein using _Beta_ as _Coloring method_.
<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/beta_factor.png" alt="">
<p class="prompt prompt-question">Does the colour scheme fit with your intuition?</p>

Let's write a new pdb without the water,  since it will be useful for the `psf` file.


* with `awk`;

* within _VMD_:
<p class="prompt prompt-tk">% set prot [atomselect top "protein"]<br>
% prot writepdb only_bpti.pdb</p>

You should have (**not**) successfully create a new `pdb` file. Why?

**NB**: Usually the water molecules in a `pdb` can play an important role in the
protein biological function. In general, it is a good practice to keep them in
your final system.

## Topology: .psf and .top in CHARMm
Let's download the latest version of the [CHARMm ff](https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml)
and extract it into our `QCB_course/` folder.

From now on, we will use _topology_ for referring to the `top_*` files of the
force field, and _structure_ for the `psf` file.

<IMG class="displayed" src="../../img/tut2/top_psf.png" alt="">
<p align="center"> <b>Topology file</b>: a collection of bricks.
<b>PSF file</b>: a subset of the top file arranged in a particular fashion.</p>

The idea is to use the `top` file to construct the `psf` of our system.

First of all, let's _list_ all the file inside this folder.
As you can see, the topology files are divided into categories:
_prot_, _lipid_, _na_...

Open the `top_all36_prot.rtf` (again with _ViM_) in a read-only mode.

You will see a first part with the `MASS` definition, then the `RESI` keywords, and eventually the `PRES` keywords.

This `top` file is like a dictionary, with all the possible words (`RESI`) you can
use in your _sentence_ (i.e. *system*).

The `PRES` are the so-called *patches* and they allow us to modify some residue if
you have a different protonation state, want to combine two residues, add a terminus...

# PSF
The `PSF` file contains the information of your system structure and the charge
information.

Each segment of the system not covalently bound to others must have a separate
psf file. For a single-chain protein in solution is trivial. You have also to write
 different `psf` if your system consists of several units, i.e. a multimer.

To write a `psf` file, we will use _VMD_ with the _Tk console_.
You can write it as a script and load it in the tk console.

```tcl
# load the namespace we need
package require psfgen
# read the information from the topology file
topology _correct_path_to_what_top_file_to_use?
# build the protein segment with name BPTI
segment BPTI {
pdb _yours_.pdb
#autoregenerate angles and dihedrals by default, NTER CTER
}
# Write down the patches we need to apply (What patches?)
patch _Patchname_ _segmentName_:_resid_ _segmentName_:resid
patch _Patchname_ _segmentName_:_resid_ _segmentName_:resid
patch _Patchname_ _segmentName_:_resid_ _segmentName_:resid
# using alias due to different atom name in pdb vs charmmff  
pdbalias atom ILE CD1 CD
# readind the coordinates
coordpdb _yours_.pdb BPTI ;# write the segname!!!!!
# guess missing coordinates: are there missing atoms?
guesscoord
# write the structure and coordinate files
writepsf out.psf
writepdb out.pdb
```
If there are no errors, load first a _new_ molecule with the `psf` and then the
`pdb` file.

<p class="prompt prompt-question">Check the N-ter and C-ter with respect to the patches in the top file.</p>

You can also use _Extension -> Autopsf_ to generate the psf file, and most of the
things will run behind the scene. ;)

To check whether the psf is ok, we can also run a small minimisation.

NAMD used an improved version of the conjugate gradient.
The aim of the minimisation is two-fold:
1. to remove the steric clashes that can be present when building a system adding elements;
2. to _move_ your structure into the ideal one provided by the topology file, with equilibrium distances, angles...

To launch the minimisation, use the `minimise.namd` that have to be completed and launch it with:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell">$ namd2 minimise.namd > bpti_min.log&</p>
