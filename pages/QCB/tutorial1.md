### Welcome to our first tutorial!

In this session we will learn the basic of visualising a protein,
play with it and a recap of what you will need.

# Software
Let's start from the basic. For this tutorial we will use [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), a visualisation program
that will allow us to render pretty images and analyse our simulations as well.
You can download it from [download VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)
with a simple registration. Choose the version `1.9.3` suitable for your operating system.


# Bash
The *Bourne Again SHell* (BASH) Let's have a quick overview of the basic of `bash` in the meanwhile.

On Ubuntu type `ctrl-alt-T` in order to open a terminal. For macOS, you should find the **Terminal** in the _Applications/_ folder.
For Windows users, use the lab computers.

Let's move in the
```
/
|---home
|---bin
|---lib
|---usr
```

```bash
cd
mkdir
cat
ls
rm
mv
cp
echo
--variable--
.bashrc
export
alias
basic-arithmetics
```

how to launch a script
<p class="prompt prompt-shell"> bash my_script.sh </p>
You can also launch an executable with `./my_script`. If you have a script and
you want to make it executable, do:
<p class="prompt prompt-shell"> chmod 700 my_script.sh</p>
If you now list
