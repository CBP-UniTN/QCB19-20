### Cheatsheet
Here you can find a small list of command you can use for `bash` and for _Vim_.


# Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ls
mkdir
mv
cp
pwd
man
echo
for i in {1..10}; do -commands- ; done
#this is a comment
chmod 700 filename #to make filename executable
```

# ViM
_ViM_ has 3 modes:
1. by default, when you launch ViM you are in **Normal** mode: you cannot type
words in it;
2. pressing `i` from **Normal** mode you go into **Insert** mode, and it works like a normale text editor;
3. pressing `v` from **Normal** mode, you go into the **Visual** mode.

**Normal** mode is like you _home_ mode: if in doubt, press `Esc` go go back
to the **Normal** mode.
